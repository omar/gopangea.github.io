I agree to uphold the following to push myself and my team **towards excellence**:

## Spirit

### 1. I will **not be afraid to be wrong**
... if someone points out my mistake, I'll respond with "You're right" and learn why I made that mistake.

### 2. I will **not be technologically religious**
... everything has pros and cons, what I'll do is list those out and help the team make the best decision.

### 3. I will **get better**
... by first acknowledging that I can always *be better*, and then learning from my mistakes, my colleagues, and from software engineering experts.

## Productivity

### 4. I will **use {{ page.issue_tracking_tool }}**
... to properly track my tasks so no one has to wonder the status of a specific task.

### 5. I will **measure twice and cut once**
... that is, I'll plan how to solve a problem, run it by another engineer, then go into heads down development.

### 6. I will **Google it first**
... and if I still can't solve it, I'll ask for help.

## Process

### 7. I will **follow standards and conventions**
... set by the team. If those need to be changed, I will propose the change for it to be adopted.

### 8. I will **automate manual tasks**
... when I do them 3 times.
 
### 9. I will **QA my work**
... before I turn it over to the QA team so that I never waste my time or my team's time.
