title: The Sprint
---

Our Kanban board for each Sprint breaks down the steps in the process where handoff happens. This allows us to **identify bottlenecks** in the Sprint so we can focus on unblocking the flow and maintain a healthy Velocity. 

<table class="kanban">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>To Do</th>
            <th>In Progress</th>
            <th>In Code Review</th>
            <th>In QA</th>
            <th>In UAT</th>
            <th>Ready for Deploy</th>
            <th>Deployed</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>The Sprint backlog where all items start</td>
            <td>Work has started</td>
            <td>Pending a code review</td>
            <td>Development complete and ready for QA</td>
            <td>QA complete and ready for Product review</td>
            <td>Reviewed by Product and ready to hop on the next release train</td>
            <td>It's in production</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>



The above steps are replicated in the JIRA Sprint boards which results in a board that looks like this:
