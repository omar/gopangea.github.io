So much has happened in 2016, it's hard to know where to start. We saw changes in both our engineering team and in our application as a whole. We released our cash-in integration, giving our customers the ability to pay for transfers with cash and expanded into California. Our engineering team also grew by 25%, and we hope to continue this trend.

Having finalized our last major release, we decided that it is a good time to take a break from scheduled product development and focus on technical improvement. [Last year’s two day hackathon was a success](2015/11/29/hackathon-2015.html), so we decided to extend it to five days and call it Hackweek. During Hackweek, the teams were given creative space to work on what they determined would bring their teams, and ultimately Pangea, the most bang for their proverbial buck.

Last year’s Hackathon was held in a hotel conference room, but this year we wanted to make it more special. Several options were considered, but ultimately we decided on [WeWork River North](https://www.wework.com/buildings/river-north--chicago--IL). Working at WeWork provided us with the means to focus on our problems without distractions, in a collaborative environment, and the additional benefit of networking with other startups in the evenings.

Many interesting ideas were brought up after a brainstorming session. Much like the previous year’s Hackathon, the items to be worked on needed to fall into one of several categories:

- Paying off technical debt.
- Fixing annoying bugs.
- Building small but awesome features.
- Documenting functions of the system.

We gathered and prioritized our items, aiming to hit all of our targets. 


### Product & Engineering

As we look [to hire](/join) additional team members, we compiled our engineering and product policies and procedures into the [Engineering Handbook](/handbook/overview/index). The handbook will help us ease onboarding and reinforce our culture. In addition, we built an interactive product documentation website (accessible internally only) to answer some of the most common questions about how our product and platform functions.

### Platform
We had multiple items to tackle, of which the first was to get our known issues count to zero. These were issues with known workarounds that required manual intervention, or issues where we could increase our resilience so we don't have to deal with it in the future.

Other items that we wanted to work on were using Swagger for our API documentation and contracting with the frontend, in addition to working on converting our workers and Admin application to .NET Core.
Increasing our resilience proved the most valuable and so we honed in our focus on this initiative. The week prior to Hackweek, our error logs had ballooned concerning one of our third party integrations. We cleaned up our logging and gave ourselves a strong recovery mechanism in the event of a disconnect with our partner. We take any concerns in production very seriously, so our continued focus here will continue to pay dividends.

The endeavor to convert the Admin application wasn’t completed due to some concerns with the .NET Core build tools, but we were able to learn more about converting our codebase to the new standard.

### Android
The Android team upgraded the UI and workflow on the app to further conform to recommendations set forward by Google. We have been making strides towards removing third party components in favor of native components. This will allow our users to feel more at home regardless of what version of Android they are running. 

Another huge achievement was to set up a continuous deployment setup for the Android app. Our Jenkins Pipeline implementation leverages Docker and Crashlytics Beta to create an environment-consistently built APK that is automatically sent to our QA team. This will allow better monitoring and usage of resources, as opposed to building the app locally.

### iOS
On the iOS front, we laid the groundwork to release our final iOS 7 app version. We will no longer be supporting iOS 7, allowing us move faster in development and update our third party libraries, which also no longer support iOS 7.

### Web
Our web team devoted their Hackweek toward migrating another large portion of our web app from Angular 1.x to React. The team never paused new feature development to work exclusively on the migration, therefore it has been a piecemeal journey from Angular to React. Hackweek provided a tremendous opportunity for a focused push towards the finish line. 

For us, completing the migration comes with benefits for our customers and our developers. Our customers will benefit from a smaller, snappier app with updated UI components. For our developers the switch to React is perhaps even more beneficial. First, React provides our web app with greater architectural flexibility, opening up new avenues for optimizing load times and performance. Further, our React codebase is easier to reason about and has better testing and analysis tools surrounding it. These characteristics translate into increased developer productivity with expanded automated test coverage. 

Our journey to an Angular free codebase is not yet complete, but Hackweek 2016 allowed our web team to begin 2017 with a completed migration within reach.


### DevOps
Given our DevOps culture, our DevOps team (consisting of one) assisted in the efforts of other teams. Regarding infrastructure, we enabled [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/details/) with some basic rules to improve our sanity by delegating enforcement of rules and resources created in our AWS account.

To further improve our deploy methodology, DevOps also completed a POC that is now rolling out to our shared development environments. This advancement on our deploy process is thanks to [AWS CodeDeploy](https://aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/). Before, our deploy to shared dev environments was inconsistent and rollback was an arduous process. With AWS CodeDeploy, our minds will be at ease when it comes to deploying code, and rollbacks will be a snap.

### QA
At Pangea, the QA process is unique, where developers are responsible for their code quality utilizing automated tests with guidance from QA engineers. The QA team revisited the entire QA process and improved the communication plan with developers, built a new test suite that covers main functionalities, touches every single screen, and removes redundancies and dependencies. With this new plan,we were able to reduce the automated regression runtime for each app from 8 hours to 2 hours.

As the company grows we need scale up to meet business demand, so we started to search for a centralized test management tool for better test planning, reporting, and requirement analysis. We researched the top tools in the market and built a proof-of-concept for each vendor. After the analysis was complete, we chose [PractiTest](https://www.practitest.com/), given its featureset compared to other tools. On the last day of Hackweek, we successfully completed migrating our test cases to PractiTest.

We achieved many goals at Hackweek and managed to create several other initiatives to investigate. It’ll be an interesting new year with big features to come. We’re looking forward to hit the ground running, so make sure to stay tuned!
